This is an analysis of data found on Gapminder.org [link](http://www.gapminder.org/data/). 

I studied variois socio-economic factors, their trends over the years and their relationships.

Some of the factors studied are extreme poverty and some indicators like economic progress, health progress and other data. I also investigated the changing face of poverty, i.e., how it has changed over the years globally for different countries around the globe.

### Some questions this project addresses are as below:
    1. How does the GDP per capita vary with years for the above countries?
    
    2. How does Extreme poverty vary with years for the above countries? Is it increasing or decreasing?
    
    3. What about overall health of the country?( I use the infant mortality and BMI (female/male) as the indicators for health of the country)
    
    4. Study different periods in history : How was GDP affected during the war and post-war
    
### Variables used for this study:

    1. Cell Phone usage (cell_phone)
    
    2. GDP per capita (Income) (gdp_per_capita)
    
    3. Mortality rate for under age 5 (under5mortality)
    
    4. Extreme Poverty (%age of population), i.e. people living at less than $1.25 per day (Poverty)
    
    5. BMI's of males and females (BMI male, BMI female)
